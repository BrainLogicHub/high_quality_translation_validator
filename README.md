## Description

This validator evaluates whether a translation is of high quality. It is useful for validating the output of language models that generate translations.

## Requirements
* Dependencies: `unbabel-comet`
* **IMPORTANT**: Steps to follow ***before** installing the validator*:
    - Please accept the gated model license from:
        https://huggingface.co/Unbabel/wmt22-cometkiwi-da
    - Get your Huggingface token from:
        https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens
        (Either create a new token or use an existing one)
    - Download Huggingface CLI:
        `pip install -U "huggingface_hub[cli]"`
    - Login into Huggingface Hub using the token:
        `huggingface-cli login --token $HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN`

## Installation

```bash
guardrails hub install hub://brainlogic/high_quality_translation
```

## Usage Examples

### Validating string output via Python

In this example, we use the `high_quality_translation` validator on any LLM generated text.

```python
# Import Guard and Validator
from guardrails.hub import HighQualityTranslation
from guardrails import Guard

# Use the Guard with the validator
guard = Guard().use(HighQualityTranslation, threshold=0.75, on_fail="exception")

# Setup Guard
guard = Guard.from_string(
    validators=[val],
)

# Test passing response
guard.validate(
    "The capital of France is Paris.",
    metadata={
        "translation_source": "Die Hauptstadt von Frankreich ist Paris."
    }
)

try:
    # Test failing response
    guard.validate(
        "France capital Paris is of The.",
        metadata={
            "translation_source": "Die Hauptstadt von Frankreich ist Paris."
        }
    )
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
```

## API Reference

**`__init__(self, threshold=0.75, on_fail="noop")`**
<ul>

Initializes a new instance of the Validator class.

**Parameters:**

- **`threshold`** *(float):* The minimum score required for a translation to be considered high quality. The score is a float between 0 and 1, where 1 is the highest quality. The default is 0.75.
- **`on_fail`** *(str, Callable):* The policy to enact when a validator fails. If `str`, must be one of `reask`, `fix`, `filter`, `refrain`, `noop`, `exception` or `fix_reask`. Otherwise, must be a function that is called when the validator fails.

</ul>

<br>

**`validate(self, value, metadata={}) -> ValidationResult`**

<ul>

Validates the given `value` using the rules defined in this validator, relying on the `metadata` provided to customize the validation process. This method is automatically invoked by `guard.parse(...)`, ensuring the validation logic is applied to the input data.

Note:

1. This method should not be called directly by the user. Instead, invoke `guard.parse(...)` where this method will be called internally for each associated Validator.
2. When invoking `guard.parse(...)`, ensure to pass the appropriate `metadata` dictionary that includes keys and values required by this validator. If `guard` is associated with multiple validators, combine all necessary metadata into a single dictionary.

**Parameters:**

- **`value`** *(Any):* The input value to validate.
- **`metadata`** *(dict):* A dictionary containing metadata required for validation. Keys and values must match the expectations of this validator.
    
    
    | Key | Type | Description | Default |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | `translation_source` | `str` | The original source text that was translated. | None |
